## Code of Conduct

Rather straightforward: please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

For rules on the actual content that quotes can have:

 > 1. Are kind, funny and safe for work: consider all of the users who may use this package on their personal, product, or internal tool websites.
> 2. Are not already there: if a quote you plan to add (or a very similar variation of it) is already there, your contribution won't be accepted.
> 3. Are correctly categorised: follow the comments in the [quotes.ts](src/quotes.ts) file to find the right spot for your quote. That way, future contributors can find quotes much easier. If this is a new category, start with a new comment at the bottom of the [quotes.ts](src/quotes.ts) file!

For more on how to contribute, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for contributing your quotes!
